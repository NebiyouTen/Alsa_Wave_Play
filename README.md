# Alsa_Wave_Play

A simple C program that uses the ALSA audio library to play wav files. [Here](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Download) is the link to the ALSA linux library. The program parses wav files and writes the data buffer to a sound card. Parsing wav files and headers was based on [this](http://truelogic.org/wordpress/2015/09/04/parsing-a-wav-file-in-c/) tutorial. 

To run use ./gcc_compile_script
It generates PCM_Wav_Play executlabe file.
